This project was made for the computer architecture 2021 class

# Requirements

In this MIPS project we must achieve the equivalent of structures in languages C, implement the equivalent of C's 'printf' function and be able to save our structures in a file and read the data from this file saved.
As an application we will model the structures C representing cars. 

The Car structure must include the following information:

1. Name of up to 16 characters, eg. : BMW, Porsche, ...
2. Pattern of up to 16 characters, eg. : X6, 325i, Panamera, 911,718 Boxster, ...
3. Year of manufacture, eg. : 2009, 2018, ...
4. Number of cylinder, eg. : 4, 6, 8, ...
5. Number of fiscal horses, eg. : 20, 30, ...
6. Convertible: true or false


The program should be able to accomplish the following tasks:

1. declare an array of structures
2. fill it by reading the user data
3. display
4. save it to a file
5. read from this file to fill in the table
